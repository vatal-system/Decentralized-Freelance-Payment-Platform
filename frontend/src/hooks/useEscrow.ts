/**
 * useEscrow.ts
 *
 * React hook that wraps all escrow / reputation contract interactions.
 *
 * Every write follows the same pipeline (see lib/stellar.ts):
 *   build → simulate → assemble → sign (Freighter) → submit → poll
 * Reads are signed-free *and wallet-free*: they simulate from the read-only
 * source in lib/stellar.ts, so a shared /jobs/:id or /profile/:address link
 * renders before anyone connects. They reject with a `ContractReadError` whose
 * `kind` separates "not found" from "unavailable" (issue #108).
 *
 * Contributor Notes:
 * - Amounts are i128 stroops (7 decimals). Use `toStroops`/`fromStroops`.
 * - `createAndFund` runs two transactions (create then fund) because the
 *   contracts keep them separate on purpose.
 * - In-flight operations are tracked per target (kind + key), so unrelated
 *   buttons stay enabled and a target cannot be submitted twice.
 * - Every write reports its lifecycle through `useToasts` (building → signing →
 *   confirmed / failed) so feedback survives navigation, and a failure carries
 *   the same mapped contract-error message the inline error shows (issue #60).
 * - A read must never go through `run()`: that helper calls `connect()`. Reads
 *   use `runRead()`, which needs no wallet and never toasts.
