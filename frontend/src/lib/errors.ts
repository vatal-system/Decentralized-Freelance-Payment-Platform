/**
 * errors.ts
 *
 * Turns raw contract/SDK errors into friendly, user-facing messages.
 *
 * Soroban surfaces a contract error as `HostError: Error(Contract, #N)`, where
 * `N` is the `#[contracterror]` discriminant from
 * `contracts/{interface,dispute,reputation}/src/lib.rs`. Callers should show the
 * mapped message when one exists and otherwise fall back to the original text —
 * this helper never throws and never hides an error.
 *
 * Note on codes: the wave-issue text lists `#7 NotExpired`, but the interface
 * enum defines `NotExpired = 6` and `ZeroAmount = 7`. These messages follow the
 * code (`contracts/interface/src/lib.rs`), which is the source of truth.
 *
 * Contributor Notes:
 * - Codes overlap between contracts (e.g. escrow `#4` is
 *   `MilestoneAlreadyReleased` but reputation `#4` is `InvalidScore`), so a few
 *   messages describe both meanings rather than guessing the contract.
 * - Public reads get a `ReadFailureKind` on top of the message, so a page can
 *   tell "this record does not exist" apart from "Stellar could not be
 *   reached" instead of blaming the link for every failure. See
 *   `classifyReadFailure`.

 * Why a public read failed, at the level of detail a page can act on:
 *
 * - `not-found`   – the contract answered "no such record", or the id/address in
 *                   the URL cannot exist at all. The link is the problem.
 * - `unavailable` – there was no answer to read: RPC/network failure, a missing
 *                   contract id, or an unreadable read-only source account. The
 *                   link is fine; retrying or fixing configuration helps.
 * - `unknown`     – the contract rejected the call for another reason (e.g. it
 *                   is not initialized); the raw message is worth showing.
