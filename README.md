# Stellar Freelance Payment Platform

A decentralized freelance payment platform built on Stellar. Enables secure, fast, transparent, and low-cost transactions between freelancers and clients — no intermediaries, no borders.

> **Testnet only.** The contracts are unaudited. Do not deploy them to mainnet or move real funds.

**Live:** frontend at <https://stellar-freelance-frontend.vercel.app> · contracts on Stellar testnet · backend API not deployed yet (see [Deployment](#deployment)).

## Live deployments

| Piece | Where | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Frontend | Vercel project `stellar-freelance-frontend` — <https://stellar-freelance-frontend.vercel.app> | ✅ Live, built with the contract ids below |
| Contracts | Stellar **testnet** (`Test SDF Network ; September 2015`) | ✅ Deployed and initialized |
| Backend API | Render (config committed, service not created yet) | ❌ Not deployed — job list needs `VITE_API_URL` |

The deployed frontend has all `VITE_*` contract variables set for Production and Preview, and deployment protection is off so the demo is reachable without a Vercel login. It is **not** connected to GitHub, so `git push` does not redeploy it:

```bash
cd frontend && vercel deploy --prod
```

## Why Stellar?

- **~5 second finality** — payments confirm faster than a bank transfer clears
- **~$0.00001 per transaction** — fees are negligible even for small milestone payments
- **USDC on Stellar** — stablecoin payments via Circle's SAC-wrapped USDC, eliminating crypto volatility for both parties
- **Soroban smart contracts** — Rust/Wasm contracts with a rich SDK and local testing environment

## How it works

1. **Client posts a job** — defines milestones (amount + deadline each) and funds the escrow contract.
2. **Freelancer delivers work** — the client releases each milestone, fully or in part, as deliverables are approved.
3. **Dispute resolution** — either party can freeze the escrow and raise a dispute; an M-of-N arbitrator panel distributes funds. If the panel stalls, a 7-day timelock unlocks an escape hatch for both parties.
4. **Reputation** — both parties rate each other on-chain after completion; scores are permanent, verifiable, and weighted by job size.

## Project status

Honest snapshot of what works today (see [`docs/TESTNET.md`](./docs/TESTNET.md) for live ids):

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| `escrow` contract | ✅ Complete — milestones (editable before funding, partial releases), expiry refunds, validated inputs, TTL, events |
| `dispute` contract | ✅ Complete — verified raise, M-of-N arbitrator panel, resolution that calls back into escrow, dispute timelock |
| `reputation` contract | ✅ Complete — escrow-verified 1–5 ratings, amount-weighted aggregates, per-pair anti-spam (`docs/REPUTATION.md`) |
| Contract tests | ✅ 84 tests: 81 unit tests (escrow 49, dispute 17, reputation 15) covering every state transition and failure path, plus 3 end-to-end tests in `contracts/dispute/tests/full_flow.rs` that drive escrow + dispute + reputation together |
| Backend tests | ✅ 43 tests |
| Frontend tests | ✅ 20 tests (Vitest + Testing Library) |
| Testnet deployment | ✅ Deployed and initialized (ids in [`deployments/testnet.json`](./deployments/testnet.json)) |
| Frontend | 🟡 Functional MVP — connect Freighter, create/fund a job, release milestones, view status, open a dispute, read reputation |
| Backend API | ✅ Routes + auth implemented; contract-event indexer syncs DB state from Soroban RPC, with a dead-letter table for events it cannot apply |
| Job discovery / filtering | ✅ Dashboard lists jobs with status/pagination (from the backend API) |
| Multi-arbitrator / timelocked disputes | ✅ Panel with a timelock escape hatch from `Disputed` (see [`docs/DISPUTES.md`](./docs/DISPUTES.md)) |
| Dispute resolution authorization | ✅ `POST /api/disputes/:id/resolve` requires an `ARBITRATOR_ADDRESSES` entry, and fails closed when unset |
| Assets beyond USDC | ✅ Registry with USDC + XLM (`docs/ASSETS.md`); any SAC can be registered |
| Wallet auth | ✅ SEP-53 message signing verified server-side, with single-use nonces persisted in PostgreSQL |
| USDC configuration | ❌ Not wired on testnet yet — the demo uses the XLM SAC |
| Security audit | ❌ Not audited |

Scoped work is tracked in [`docs/wave-issues/`](./docs/wave-issues/).

## Architecture

Three Soroban contracts work together; the escrow contract holds the funds and is the only contract that can move them.

```
Client ── create / fund / release_milestone / release_partial / reclaim_* ──► EscrowContract
                                                                                 │  ▲
                                          arbitrate() ── resolve() ──┘  │ (dispute contract only)
DisputeContract ◄── Arbitrator                                        │
      │  verifies escrow is Disputed + caller is on the panel         │
      └── submit(rater, ratee, escrow_id, score) ─► ReputationContract
                      (verifies the job Completed + participants)
```

- **escrow** enforces the state machine `Created → Active → Completed`, with
  `Disputed → Completed` (via arbitration) and `Active → Refunded` (expiry).
- **dispute** can only change escrow funds through `escrow.resolve`, which
  independently checks that the shares sum to the funds held.
- **reputation** refuses any rating unless escrow reports the job `Completed`
  and the rater/ratee are the two participants.
- **backend** never holds funds or keys. It builds unsigned transactions for the
  frontend to sign, and mirrors on-chain state into PostgreSQL by indexing events.

The shared `interface` crate holds the types both contracts and clients agree on
(`Milestone`, `EscrowData`, `EscrowError`), so encodings cannot drift apart.
The events each contract emits are catalogued in [`docs/EVENTS.md`](./docs/EVENTS.md).

## Contract reference

### `escrow`

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `init(admin, dispute_contract)` | One-shot setup; records the only contract allowed to call `resolve` |
| `set_dispute_contract(dispute_contract)` | Admin-only, for rotating the dispute contract |
| `create(client, freelancer, token, milestones, expiry)` | Creates an unfunded escrow and returns its id |
| `update_milestones(escrow_id, milestones)` | Client-only milestone editing, before funding |
| `fund(escrow_id)` | Moves the asset into escrow and activates the job |
| `release_milestone(escrow_id, milestone_index)` | Releases a whole milestone to the freelancer |
| `release_partial(escrow_id, milestone_index, amount)` | Releases part of a milestone; tracks `released_amount` |
| `open_dispute(escrow_id, initiator)` | Either participant freezes the escrow |
| `reclaim_after_dispute_timeout(escrow_id)` | Escape hatch once the 7-day dispute timelock passes |
| `resolve(escrow_id, client_share, freelancer_share)` | Dispute-contract-only; splits the funds |
| `reclaim_expired(escrow_id)` | Client refund after expiry with nothing released |
| `get(escrow_id)` / `dispute_deadline(escrow_id)` / `dispute_contract()` | Read-only views |

### `dispute`

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `init(arbitrators, threshold)` | One-shot setup; validates a non-empty panel and `1 <= threshold <= len` |
| `raise(escrow_id, initiator)` | Verifies the escrow is `Disputed` and the caller is a party |
| `approve(dispute_id, arbitrator, client_share, freelancer_share)` | A panel vote; shares must sum to the escrowed total |
| `arbitrate(dispute_id)` | Executes the split once approvals reach the threshold |
| `get(dispute_id)` / `dispute_for(escrow_id)` / `arbitrators()` / `threshold()` | Read-only views |

### `reputation`

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `init(admin, escrow_contract)` | One-shot setup |
| `submit(rater, ratee, escrow_id, score)` | 1–5 rating for a `Completed` job, one per pair per job |
| `get_aggregate(address)` | Amount-weighted `{ total_score, weight, count }` |
| `get_rating(rater, escrow_id)` | A single rating |

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Backend API

Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL. Every `POST`/`PUT` below except `/api/users/auth`
requires `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`; mutating routes that touch the chain
return an **unsigned XDR** for the client to sign, and never a key.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/health` | — | Liveness probe (used by the container health check) |
| `GET` | `/api/users/challenge` | — | Issue a single-use nonce for SEP-53 signing |
| `POST` | `/api/users/auth` | — | Verify the signed message, return a JWT |
| `GET` | `/api/users/:address` | — | Public profile |
| `PUT` | `/api/users/me` | ✅ | Update your own profile |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs` | — | List jobs with status filter + pagination |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs` | ✅ | Create the off-chain job record |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/:id` | — | Job detail with milestones |
| `PUT` | `/api/jobs/:id/assign` | ✅ | Assign a freelancer |
| `POST` | `/api/escrow/build/create` | ✅ | Build `escrow.create` |
| `POST` | `/api/escrow/build/fund` | ✅ | Build `escrow.fund` |
| `POST` | `/api/escrow/build/release` | ✅ | Build `escrow.release_milestone` |
| `POST` | `/api/escrow/build/reclaim` | ✅ | Build `escrow.reclaim_expired` |
| `POST` | `/api/escrow/sync/:jobId` | ✅ | Link an escrow id to a job |
| `POST` | `/api/disputes` | ✅ | Build `escrow.open_dispute` and record the dispute |
| `GET` | `/api/disputes/:id` | — | Dispute detail |
| `POST` | `/api/disputes/:id/resolve` | ✅ + arbitrator | Build `dispute.arbitrate` |
| `POST` | `/api/reputation` | ✅ | Build `reputation.submit` |
| `GET` | `/api/reputation/:address` | — | Aggregate reputation |

Rate limiting is 100 requests/minute per IP. The **event indexer** runs
in-process, polling Soroban RPC for the configured contracts and applying events
to the database. Failures are recorded in `IndexerDeadLetter` rather than
dropped, and the cursor is persisted so restarts resume where they left off.

## Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite, with Freighter for signing.

| Route | Page | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | `Dashboard` | Filterable, paginated job list from the API |
| `/post` | `PostJob` | Milestones + asset picker → on-chain create/fund, then the off-chain record |
| `/jobs/:id` | `JobDetail` | Milestone state (incl. `released_amount`), release, dispute, transaction links |
| `/profile/:address` | `Profile` | On-chain reputation and job history |

Every write shows the transaction hash and a stellar.expert link, contract errors
are mapped to readable messages (`frontend/src/lib/errors.ts`), and per-target
pending state stops double submits.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Smart contracts | Rust (edition 2021) + Soroban SDK **29.0.0**, compiled to Wasm for `wasm32v1-none` |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 5, React Router 6, Vitest + Testing Library |
| Wallet | Freighter browser extension (SEP-53 message signing) |
| Backend | Express 4 + Prisma 5 + PostgreSQL, Zod validation, JWT (`jose`), Helmet, rate limiting |
| Chain access | `@stellar/stellar-sdk` 12 (Soroban RPC + Horizon) |
| CI | GitHub Actions — contracts (fmt, clippy, test, wasm build), frontend, backend |

## Getting started

### One command (Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | <http://localhost:5173> |
| Backend | <http://localhost:3000> (`GET /health`) |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` |

Pass contract ids through the environment to bake them into the frontend image:

```bash
VITE_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID=C... docker compose up --build
```

### Manual

```bash
# Contracts
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cd contracts && cargo test

# Backend (needs a running PostgreSQL)
cd backend && npm ci && npx prisma generate
cp .env.example .env          # then fill DATABASE_URL + JWT_SECRET (>= 32 chars)
npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm ci
cp .env.example .env          # then fill the VITE_* contract ids
npm run dev
```

Deploy and exercise the contracts on testnet:

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet --fund
scripts/deploy_testnet.sh     # builds, deploys, initializes, records ids
scripts/demo_testnet.sh       # create → fund → release → rate → aggregate
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for conventions and the manual setup in full.

## Configuration

Vite **inlines** `VITE_*` variables at build time, so changing one needs a rebuild,
not just a restart.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `VITE_NETWORK` | ✅ | `testnet` (or `mainnet`, which is unsupported) |
| `VITE_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | Deployed escrow contract |
| `VITE_DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | Deployed dispute contract |
| `VITE_REPUTATION_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | Deployed reputation contract |
| `VITE_API_URL` | for hosted deploys | Backend origin; defaults to `http://localhost:3000` |
| `VITE_XLM_CONTRACT_ID` | to pay in XLM | Testnet XLM SAC: `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC` |
| `VITE_USDC_CONTRACT_ID` | to pay in USDC | Empty until a USDC SAC is configured on testnet |

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | **At least 32 characters** — the config schema exits the process otherwise |
| `NODE_ENV` | ✅ | `development` \| `production` \| `test` |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | ✅ | `testnet` \| `mainnet` |
| `HORIZON_URL` | ✅ | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | ✅ | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | Without it the indexer logs `No contract IDs configured` and does nothing |
| `DISPUTE_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | As above |
| `REPUTATION_CONTRACT_ID` | ✅ | As above |
| `XLM_CONTRACT_ID` | to pay in XLM | Testnet XLM SAC |
| `USDC_CONTRACT_ID` | to pay in USDC | Empty until USDC is configured |
| `ARBITRATOR_ADDRESSES` | for dispute resolution | Comma-separated panel addresses allowed to call `POST /api/disputes/:id/resolve`. **Empty disables the route** — it fails closed |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | for production | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to call the API. Empty allows every origin and logs a warning in production |
| `INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | — | Defaults to `5000` |
| `PORT` | — | Defaults to `3000` |

## Testing

```bash
# Contracts — 84 tests (81 unit + 3 integration)
cd contracts
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
stellar contract build          # requires stellar-cli v25.2.0+

# Backend — 43 tests
cd backend
npx prisma generate
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test

# Frontend — 20 tests
cd frontend
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test
npm run build
```

CI runs all three on every push and pull request to `main`
([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)).

## Deployment

Contract ids change on every deploy. `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` regenerates
`frontend/.env` automatically (backing up the previous file) so the app never
keeps pointing at superseded contracts.

| Piece | Host | Why there |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Contracts | Stellar testnet | Only supported network; unaudited |
| Frontend | Vercel (or any static host) | Static Vite build; `frontend/vercel.json` carries the SPA rewrite React Router needs |
| Backend | Render, via [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) | Needs a long-running process: the indexer polls Soroban RPC in-process, so serverless is not an option |

`backend/Dockerfile` applies migrations on start. CORS must be set to the
frontend origin, and `ARBITRATOR_ADDRESSES` must list the dispute panel.

Two operational notes for the free tiers: the Render service spins down when
idle, which pauses the indexer until it wakes and catches up from its persisted
cursor, and the prepared `render.yaml` leaves `DATABASE_URL` for you to set
because it creates no database.

## Security and limitations

- **Unaudited and testnet-only.** The escrow, dispute, and reputation contracts
  have not been reviewed by a third party. Never move real funds.
- **The backend holds no keys and cannot move funds.** It returns unsigned XDR
  for the client to sign, and mirrors chain state into PostgreSQL.
- **The indexer trusts Soroban RPC.** Events it cannot apply land in
  `IndexerDeadLetter` instead of being dropped, because its cursor advances
  regardless — check that table after a deploy that changes event payloads.
- **Soroban RPC retains a rolling window (~7 days).** A fresh indexer starts just
  behind the chain tip rather than at genesis; a cursor older than the window is
  clamped, and the events in between are unrecoverable.
- **USDC is not wired on testnet yet** — the demo pays with the XLM SAC.
- **Rating strength is not identity-aware.** Amount-weighting and per-pair
  anti-spam raise the cost of farming, but a determined actor with many funded
  pairs can still inflate an aggregate.

## Inspiration

This project draws on patterns proven by:

- **Braintrust** (Ethereum/Polygon) — user-owned talent network, 0% freelancer fees
- **Canwork.io** (BNB Chain) — 1% fee, smart-contract escrow
- **.escrow** (Polkadot) — USDT-based escrow with configurable timelocks

Stellar's fee structure and finality speed make it a better fit for the global freelance market than any of these predecessors.
